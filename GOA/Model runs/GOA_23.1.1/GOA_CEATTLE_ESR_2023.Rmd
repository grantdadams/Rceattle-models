## Summary statement:

The climate-enhanced multispecies model (CEATTLE) for the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) estimates that natural mortality due to all sources has increased sightly for age-1 pollock and decreased slightly for arrowtooth flounder and is below the long-term mean. Age-1 natural mortality for Pacific cod has increased in recent  years, but remains below the long-term mean as well. Estimates of biomass consumed of pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder as prey across all ages is currently below the long term mean.

## Status and trends:  

Estimated age-1 natural mortality (M) for walleye pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder peaked in `r peak_M_years[1]` for pollock, `r peak_M_years[4]` for Pacific cod, and `r peak_M_years[2]` for arrowtooth flounder (Fig. 1). Average age-1 M estimated by CEATTLE was greatest for pollock (`r round(avg_M[1],2)` yr$^{-1}$) and lower for Pacific cod (`r round(avg_M[4],2)` yr$^{-1}$) and arrowtooth (`r round(avg_M[2],2)` yr$^{-1}$ for females and `r round(avg_M[3],2)` yr$^{-1}$ for males). After increasing slightly in recent years, pollock age-1 M still remained lower in `r thisYr` at `r round(terminal_M[1],2)` yr$^{-1}$ relative to the long-term mean `r round(avg_M[1],2)` yr$^{-1}$ and the values used for single species assessment (age-1 M = 1.39; Fig. 1). Additionally, Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder age-1 M were below the long-term mean after increasing and decreasing, respectively, in recent years (Fig. 1), but above the values used/estimated for the single species assessment of 0.46 yr$^{-1}$ (Pacific cod), 0.2 yr$^{-1}$ (arrowtooth females), and 0.35 yr$^{-1}$ (arrowtooth males), with total age-1 M at around `r round(terminal_M[4],2)` yr$^{-1}$ for Pacific cod `r round(terminal_M[2],2)` yr$^{-1}$ for arrowtooth females, and `r round(terminal_M[3],2)` yr$^{-1}$ for arrowtooth males. `r thisYr` age-1 M across species is `r min(prcnt_change)`% to `r max(prcnt_change)`% lower than in  peak years.

On average `r avg_Age1_Beaten[1]` mt of age-1 pollock, `r avg_Age1_Beaten[3]` mt of age-1 Pacific cod, and `r avg_Age1_Beaten[2]` mt of age-1 arrowtooth flounder was consumed annually by species included in CEATTLE between 1977 and `r thisYr`. For `r thisYr`, we estimated `r terminal_Age1_Beaten[1]` mt of age-1 pollock, `r terminal_Age1_Beaten[4]` mt of age-1 Pacific cod, `r terminal_Age1_Beaten[2]` mt of age-1 arrowtooth females, and `r terminal_Age1_Beaten[3]` mt of age-1 arrowtooth males was consumed by species included in CEATTLE. Across all ages `r avg_Beaten[1]` mt of pollock, `r avg_Beaten[2]` mt of arrowtooth flounder, `r avg_Beaten[3]` mt of Pacific cod was consumed annually, on average, by species included in CEATTLE. The total biomass consumed of pollock as prey across all ages decreased in `r thisYr` compared to `r thisYr-1` (Fig. 2). The total biomass consumed of arrowtooth flounder and Pacific cod has decreased in recent years. However, the total biomass consumed as prey across all ages for all species is currently below the long term mean.


## Factors influencing observed trends

Temporal patterns in total natural mortality reflect annually varying changes in predation mortality by pollock, Pacific cod, Pacific halibut, and arrowtooth flounder that primarily impact age-1 fish (but also impact older age classes). Predation mortality at age-1 for all species in the model was primarily driven by arrowtooth flounder (Fig. 3) and arrowtooth flounder biomass has declined in recent years. Increases in biomass consumed of walleye pollock in 2022 relative to 2020 reflect elevated recruitment of age-1 pollock in 2021 that was available to the modelled predators. Combined annual predation demand (annual ration) of age-4+ pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder in `r thisYr` was `r round(sum(terminal_Ration)/1e6,2)` hundred thousand tons, down from the `r round(sum(avg_Ration)/1e6,2)` hundred thousand ton annual average (Fig. 4). 


## Implications: 

We find evidence of continued below average predation mortality on age-1 pollock and arrowtooth flounder due to the species modelled in CEATTLE. Previous ecosystem modelling efforts have estimated that mortality of pollock is primarily driven by Pacific cod (16%), Pacific halibut (23%) and arrowtooth flounder (33%)(Gaichas et al., 2015). Declines in total predator biomass are contributing to an overall decline in total consumption and therefore reduced predation mortality. Between 1990 and 2010, relatively high natural mortality rates reflect patterns in annual demand for prey from arrowtooth flounder, whose biomass peaked during this time period. A strong recruitment of age-1 pollock in 2021 has led to an increase in biomass of pollock being consumed by predators. 

## Description of index: 

We report trends in age-1 natural mortality for walleye pollock (_Gadus chalcogrammus_), Pacific cod (_Gadus macrocephalus_) and arrowtooth flounder (_Atheresthes stomias_), from the Gulf of Alaska (USA). Total natural mortality rates are based on model estimated sex-specific, time- and age-invariant residual mortality (M1) and model estimates of time- and age-varying predation mortality (M2) produced from the multi-species statistical catch-at-age assessment model (known as CEATTLE; Climate-Enhanced, Age-based model with Temperature-specific Trophic Linkages and Energetics). The model is based, in part, on the parameterization and data used for recent stock assessment models of each species (see Adams et al., 2022 for more detail). The model is fit to data from five fisheries and seven surveys between 1977 and `r thisYr` and includes inputs of abundance-at-age from recent stock assessment models for Pacific halibut scaled to the proportion of age-5+ biomass in IPHC management area 3 (Stewart & Hicks, 2021). Model estimates of predation mortality are empirically derived by bioenergetics-based consumption information and diet data from the GOA to inform predator-prey suitability (Holsman & Aydin, 2015; Holsman, Aydin, Sullivan, Hurst, & Kruse, 2019).
