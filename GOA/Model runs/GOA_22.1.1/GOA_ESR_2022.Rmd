**Last Updated: September `r 2022`** 

## Summary statement:

The climate-enhanced multispecies model (CEATTLE) for the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) estimates that natural mortality for age-1 pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder due to all sources has declined in recent years and is below the long-term mean. Alternatively, estimates of biomass consumed of pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder as prey across all ages has increased and is currently above the long term mean for pollock and Pacific cod.

## Status and trends:  

Estimated age-1 natural mortality (M) for walleye Pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder peaked in `r peak_M_years[1]` for pollock, `r peak_M_years[4]` for P. cod, and `r peak_M_years[2]` for arrowtooth flounder (Fig. 1). At an average of `r round(avg_M[1],2)` yr$^{-1}$, age-1 M estimated by CEATTLE was greatest for pollock and lower for Pacific cod (`r round(avg_M[4],2)` yr$^{-1}$) and arrowtooth (`r round(avg_M[2],2)` yr$^{-1}$ for females and `r round(avg_M[3],2)` yr$^{-1}$ for males). After decreasing in recent years, pollock age-1 M remained lower in `r thisYr` at `r round(terminal_M[1],2)` yr$^{-1}$ (SD = `r round(terminal_M_sd[1],2)`) relative to the long-term mean `r round(avg_M[1],2)` yr$^{-1}$ and the values used for single species assessment (age-1 M = 1.39; Fig. 1). Additionally, Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder age-1 M were below the long-term mean after decreasing in recent years (Fig. 1), but above the values used/estimated for the single species assessment of 0.50 yr$^{-1}$ (Pacific cod), 0.2 yr$^{-1}$ (arrowtooth females), and 0.35 yr$^{-1}$ (arrowtooth males), with total age-1 M at around `r round(terminal_M[4],2)` yr$^{-1}$ (SD = `r round(terminal_M_sd[4],2)`) for P. cod `r round(terminal_M[2],2)` yr$^{-1}$ (SD = `r round(terminal_M_sd[2],2)`) for arrowtooth females, and `r round(terminal_M[3],2)` yr$^{-1}$ (SD = `r round(terminal_M_sd[3],2)`) for arrowtooth males. `r thisYr` age-1 M across species is `r min(prcnt_change)`% to `r max(prcnt_change)`% lower than in  peak years.

On average `r avg_Age1_Beaten[1]` mt of age-1 pollock, `r avg_Age1_Beaten[3]` mt of age-1 Pacific cod, and `r avg_Age1_Beaten[2]` mt of age-1 arrowtooth flounder was consumed annually by species included in CEATTLE. Across all ages `r avg_Beaten[1]` mt of pollock, `r avg_Beaten[2]` mt of arrowtooth flounder, `r avg_Beaten[3]` mt of Pacific cod was consumed annually, on average, by species included in the model. The total biomass consumed of pollock as prey across all ages increased in `r thisYr` compared to `r thisYr-1` (Fig. 2). The total biomass consumed of arrowtooth flounder and Pacific cod has also increased in recent years. The total biomass consumed of pollock and Pacific cod as prey across all ages is currently above the long term mean.


## Factors influencing observed trends

Temporal patterns in total natural mortality reflect annually varying changes in predation mortality by pollock, P. cod, Pacific halibut, and arrowtooth flounder that primarily impact age-1 fish (but also impact older age classes). Predation mortality at age-1 for all species in the model was primarily driven by arrowtooth flounder (Fig. 3) and arrowtooth flounder biomass has declined and remained relatively constant in recent years. Increases in biomass consumed of walleye Pollock in 2021 relative to 2020 reflect elevated recruitment of age-1 pollock in 2021 that was available to the modelled predators. Combined annual predation demand (annual ration) of age-4+ pollock, P. cod, and arrowtooth flounder in `r thisYr` was `r round(sum(terminal_Ration)/1e6,2)` hundred thousand tons, down slightly from the `r round(sum(avg_Ration)/1e6,2)` hundred thousand ton annual average (Fig. 4). 


## Implications: 

We find evidence of continued decline in predation mortality on age-1 pollock, Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder due to the species modelled in CEATTLE. Previous ecosystem modelling efforts have estimated that mortality of pollock is primarily driven by P. cod (16%), Pacific halibut (23%) and arrowtooth flounder (33%)(Gaichas et al., 2015). Declines in total predator biomass are contributing to an overall decline in total consumption and therefore reduced predation mortality. Between 1990 and 2010, relatively high natural mortality rates reflect patterns in annual demand for prey from arrowtooth flounder, whose biomass peaked during this time period. A strong recruitment of age-1 pollock in 2021 has led to an increase in biomass of pollock being consumed by predators. Decreases in predation mortality in recent years suggest that the disappearance of the large age-1 recruitment of pollock in 2019 was not due wholly to predation by species included in the model.

## Description of index: 

We report trends in age-1 natural mortality for walleye pollock (_Gadus chalcogrammus_), P. cod (_Gadus macrocephalus_) and arrowtooth flounder (_Atheresthes stomias_), from the Gulf of Alaska (USA). Total natural mortality rates are based on model estimated sex-specific, time- and age-invariant residual mortality (M1) and model estimates of time- and age-varying predation mortality (M2) produced from the multi-species statistical catch-at-age assessment model (known as CEATTLE; Climate-Enhanced, Age-based model with Temperature-specific Trophic Linkages and Energetics). The model is based, in part, on the parameterization and data used for recent stock assessment models of each species (see Adams et al., 2022 for more detail). The model is fit to data from five fisheries and seven surveys between 1977 and 2022 and includes inputs of abundance-at-age from recent stock assessment models for Pacific halibut scaled to the proportion of age-5+ biomass in IPHC management area 3 (Stewart & Hicks, 2021). Model estimates of predation mortality are empirically derived by bioenergetics-based consumption information and diet data from the GOA to inform predator-prey suitability (Holsman & Aydin, 2015; Holsman, Aydin, Sullivan, Hurst, & Kruse, 2019).
