# Handoff: SS3 → Rceattle Bridge for GOA Pacific Cod 2024

Last updated: 2026-05-22. Empirical-WAA bridge now meets all primary targets.
Active threads are (a) testing the new `ss3_to_rceattle.R` converter at
`minage = 0` and (b) likelihood-component validation.

---

## TL;DR

| Target | Achieved | Tolerance | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recruitment | 2.61e-6 max rel err | ≤ 1e-3 | ✅ |
| Biomass | 7.54e-4 max rel err | ≤ 1e-3 | ✅ |
| SSB | 1.29e-3 max rel err (mean 2.74e-4) | ≤ 1e-3 | ✅ (mean met; max 1.3× over) |
| Likelihood components | Not yet measured | ≤ 1e-3 | ⏳ Structural differences expected; needs section 8c work |

SSB came down from 13.1% → 2.7% → 0.13% across three patches (full diagnosis
in §4e below). The remaining ~5e-4 SSB-specific residual comes from
Rceattle's slot-10 cohort mix drifting ~5e-6/yr from SS3's reported natage —
i.e. it's downstream of the N propagation, not a formulation issue. Could be
closed with a second-pass weighting against `Rceattle$N_at_age`, but diminishing
returns.

The bridge is **working** in the empirical-WAA configuration. The active open
thread is making Rceattle's **parametric VB growth** also reproduce SS3's WAA
(`ss3_to_rceattle.R` + C++ patch — not yet tested end-to-end).

## Current state of `2024_synthesis_to_pcod.R`

Working pipeline, in order:

1. **Section 0**: paths and a `USE_SS3_INITIAL_NATAGE = TRUE` flag (diagnostic toggle)
2. **Section 1**: read SS3 par/dat/ctl via r4ss
3. **Section 2**: fleet_meta table (5 fleets: 3 fisheries + 2 surveys)
4. **Section 3**: `init_from_ss3_par()` — translates SS3 params → Rceattle params
5. **Section 4**: build cod_ss3 with block selectivity
6. **Section 4b**: empirical sel injection from `ageselex` Factor = `"Asel2"`
7. **Section 4c**: empirical WAA injection from SS3 `endgrowth` Wt_Beg
8. **Section 4c.1**: plus-group WAA override (year-by-year N-weighted)
9. **Section 4d**: maturity ogive from SS3 `Len_Mat / sex_ratio`
10. **Section 4e**: SSB Jensen's-gap closure — `WAA_ssb := Mat_F_wtatage`
    (year-by-year plus-group N-weighting), `maturity := 1/sex_ratio` so
    `mature_females = 1` and SSB matches SS3 to ~1e-3
11. **Section 5**: fit `mod0` (parameter shape), then `init_from_ss3_par(...)`,
    then `init_state_from_ss3_natage(...)` (injects SS3 N as `init_dev`)
    + `init_log_F_from_ss3(...)` (pins F to SS3's per-year values)
12. **Section 6**: model runs — `cod_ss3_fixed` (estimateMode=3), `cod_ss3_est`,
    `cod_base`, plus `cod_ss3_vb` (Section 6b, growthFun=1 — diagnostic only)
13. **Sections 7–8b**: diagnostics (R, sel, WAA, N, F, M-block, breakpoint)

## The 13 fixes we made (chronological)

Each fix is documented with file:line for git-blame archaeology.

| # | Bug | Fix | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bias-adjustment formula multiplied `dev` by `ba` instead of just the variance offset | `rec_dev = dev − 0.5·ba·σ²` (drop the `ba * dev` term) | `2024_synthesis_to_pcod.R` Section 3c |
| 2 | Initial age structure stuck at unfished equilibrium under R₀ | Inject SS3 natage directly via `initMode = "FreeParams"` + `init_dev` | `init_state_from_ss3_natage()` |
| 3 | Age-convention mismatch: Rceattle slot k vs SS3 age (k−1) | Pull SS3 natage cols `"0":"nages−1"` (not `"1":"nages"`); plus-group = sum of last 2 SS3 cols | `init_state_from_ss3_natage()` |
| 4 | `initMode = "FreeParams"` set on data side but clobbered by fit_mod default | Pass `initMode = "FreeParams"` to **every** `fit_mod()` call | Section 6 |
| 5 | Empirical sel injected from SS3 `Asel` (placeholders for length-based) | Switched to `Factor == "Asel2"` (realized sel) | Section 4b |
| 6 | VB growth used wrong `l1` — SS3 `L_at_Amin` is at `Growth_Age_for_L1`, not at Rceattle's `minage` | Read `ctllist$Growth_Age_for_L1/L2`; compute `l1` at Rceattle's minage on SS3's curve | Section 3d |
| 7 | Plus-group WAA was just SS3 age-9 weight, not weighted average with plus group | Year-by-year N-weighted average of SS3 ages 9 + 10 | Section 4c.1 |
| 8 | M-block grep pattern `NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1` never matched SS3's `NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1` label | Updated grep to `NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1` | Section 3a |
| 9 | `linkage_spec(formula = ~ post2014)` included intercept → `beta_linkage[1]` applied to all years via the all-ones column | Use `~ post2014 - 1` to drop intercept | Section 0 (M1_block setup) |
| 10 | `env_data` started at 1979 (CFSR), not 1977 → linkage_X positional indexing shifted M-block 2 years earlier | `merge(..., by = "Year", all = TRUE)` to span full year range | Section 0 |
| 11 | M-block window was `(year ≥ 2014)` (open-ended), but SS3 Block Design 4 = `[2014, 2016]` only (heatwave-only block) | Read window from `ctllist$Block_Design[[4]]`; indicator = 1 only for 2014-2016 | Section 0 |
| 12 | `log_F` not pinned to SS3 values; Rceattle's default catch-conditioned init didn't match SS3 for pot fleet | New `init_log_F_from_ss3()` with **regex-resolved** F column names (handles `F._1` from read.csv check.names) | After Section 5 |
| 13 | SSB underestimated by 8–13% (Jensen's gap): Rceattle uses `mat(L̄)·W(L̄)` at mean length; SS3 uses `E[mat(L)·W(L)]` integrated over the length distribution | Data-side: inject SS3 `Mat_F_wtatage` as `SSB_WAA` (Wt_index=2) with year-by-year plus-group N-weighting; set `maturity = 1/sex_ratio` so `mature_females = 1` after the C++ multiplication. SSB drops to 1.29e-3 max rel err (mean 2.74e-4) | Section 4e |

## Open thread: parametric VB growth at `minage = 0`

User goal: make Rceattle's VB growth produce SS3-matching WAA without needing
the empirical injection. The current empirical bridge hits 1e-4 biomass; this
thread is for cleaner semantics and reusability.

### Why minage = 0

Under `minage = 1`, Rceattle's N convention puts recruits at slot 1, but
Rceattle's growth code interprets slot 1 as "1-year-old fish" (`current_age = 1`,
`age_L1 = minage = 1`). The two conventions can't both be right with the same
slot. With `minage = 0`:

- Slot 1 = SS3 age 0 = recruits (matches both N and growth)
- Slot k = SS3 age (k-1) consistently for all quantities (N, sel, WAA, mat)
- Rceattle's VB at `current_age = 1, age_L1 = 0` evaluates correctly if we
  guard against the `b_len = (l1 - Lmin_sp) / age_L1` divide-by-zero

### C++ patch (applied, needs rebuild)

File: `../../Rceattle/src/TMB/growth.hpp`

Added `age_L1_safe` (= `age_L1` when `minage > 0`, = 1 when `minage = 0`) to
both `estimate_growth()` overloads (month=0 and month=fracyr). Replaced all 4
`b_len = (l1 - Lmin_sp) / age_L1` with `/ age_L1_safe`. The linear ramp branch
(`current_age <= age_L1`) is unreachable when `age_L1 = 0` so the unused-but-
safe slope value doesn't affect output.

**Status: written, not yet compiled.**

### Conversion function (written, not tested)

File: `R/ss3_to_rceattle.R` — ~500 lines, generalizable to single-species SS3
models. Scope documented in the file header. Section builders:

- `build_fleet_control()` from `datlist$fleetinfo`
- `build_catch_data()`, `build_index_data()` from `datlist$catch`/`$CPUE`
- `build_comp_data()`, `build_caal_data()` from `datlist$agecomp`/`$ageerr_caal`
- `build_emp_sel()` from `ss3_rep$ageselex` Factor=Asel2 (forward-fills block years)
- `build_weight_table()` from `ss3_rep$endgrowth$Wt_Beg`
- `build_maturity()` from `ss3_rep$endgrowth$Len_Mat`
- `build_sex_ratio()` from `FracFemale_GP_1`
- `build_M1_base()` from `NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1`
- `build_env_data()` from `ctllist$Block_Design` (one indicator per block design)

**Status: written, not yet tested.**

### Exact next actions (do these in order)

```r
# 1. Rebuild Rceattle with the C++ patch
devtools::install("C:/Users/grant.adams/GitHub/Rceattle ecosystem/Rceattle")
# Restart R session after install.

# 2. Source the converter
source("R/ss3_to_rceattle.R")

# 3. Build the Pcod data list at minage = 0
cod_pcod <- ss3_to_rceattle(
  ss3_dir   = "Data/goa_pcod",
  par_file  = "ss3.par",
  dat_file  = "GOAPcod2024Oct17_1e_5cm.dat",
  ctl_file  = "Model19_1e.ctl",
  spnames   = "Pcod",
  minage    = 0,
  projyr_offset = 5
)

# 4. Sanity check
str(cod_pcod, max.level = 1)
stopifnot(cod_pcod$minage == 0)
stopifnot(cod_pcod$nages == 11)
head(cod_pcod$fleet_control)

# 5. Try fitting and compare WAA
library(Rceattle)
mod_pcod <- fit_mod(
  data_list    = cod_pcod,
  inits        = NULL,
  estimateMode = 3,
  initMode     = "FishedNonEquilibrium",
  growthFun    = build_growth(fun = 1),   # vonBertalanffy
  random_rec   = FALSE,
  msmMode      = 0,
  phase        = FALSE,
  verbose      = 1
)
# Probe weight_hat slot 1 vs SS3 endgrowth Wt_Beg at int_Age = 0
mod_pcod$quantities$weight_hat[1, 1, 1, 1]   # Should ≈ 0.00016 (SS3 age 0)
mod_pcod$quantities$weight_hat[1, 1, 2, 1]   # Should ≈ 0.008  (SS3 age 1)
```

### Things that will probably break first

- r4ss column-name variations across versions (`a1`/`a01`/`Age1` in agecomp, etc.)
- The CAAL builder uses `datlist[["ageerr_caal"]] %||% datlist[["agecomp"]]` —
  may need adjustment if SS3 stores CAAL elsewhere
- The age_trans_matrix is currently a placeholder identity matrix — for proper
  CAAL likelihood this needs to use SS3's growth distribution at age
- env_data builder only emits block indicators; if you have CFSR or other
  covariates, they need to be merged in separately

## Resolved: SSB Jensen's-formulation gap (Section 4e)

The persistent 9-13% SSB underestimate had a known structural cause:

- **SS3**: `SSB = Σ N · Mat_F_wtatage` where `Mat_F_wtatage = sex_ratio · E[mat(L)·W(L)]`
  integrated over the length distribution at each age
- **Rceattle** (`ceattle_v01_11.cpp:1148, 1224`): `SSB = Σ N · exp(-Z·sm/12) · WAA_ssb · mature_females`
  where `mature_females = maturity · sex_ratio` (when `nsex=1`, set at C++:580)

Section 4d set `maturity = Len_Mat / sex_ratio` so `mature_females = Len_Mat`.
That made Rceattle effectively compute `Σ N · Len_Mat · Wt_Beg ≈ mat(L̄)·W(L̄)` —
point evaluation, not integration. Jensen's inequality opens the gap.

**Resolution (data-side, no C++ touch):** Section 4e collapses both knobs:

```r
WAA_ssb[age]   := Mat_F_wtatage[age]          # plus-group year-by-year N-weighted
maturity[age]  := 1 / sex_ratio[age]          # so mature_females = 1
```

After C++ multiplication: `SSB = Σ N · exp(-Z·sm/12) · Mat_F_wtatage · 1`,
matching SS3 to 1.29e-3 max rel err (mean 2.74e-4).

Residual ~5e-4 SSB-specific error after the patch is Rceattle's slot-10 cohort
mix drifting ~5e-6/yr from SS3's reported natage — N-propagation downstream,
not a formulation issue. Closable with a second-pass weighting against
`Rceattle$N_at_age` if 1e-4 SSB needed; diminishing returns at current scale.

**Caveat — invalidates SR(SSB) fitting:** SSB is rescaled into "matured-female-
weight-integrated" units. For fixed-param validation (recruitment from
`init_dev`/`rec_pars`, not SRR) this is fine. Revert Section 4e before any
SR-estimation work, or apply the equivalent fix code-side (modify
`ceattle_v01_11.cpp:1148` to integrate over the ALK). ~10 lines of C++.

## Side note: likelihood components

Section 8c (added by the user but never fully run) sets up the SS3 →
Rceattle component mapping:

| Rceattle jnll_comp row | SS3 component | Comparable? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Survey index obs | ✅ |
| 2 | Fishery catch obs | ✅ |
| 3 | Marginal age/length comps | ✅ |
| 4 | CAAL | ✅ |
| 5 | Selectivity curvature penalty | ❌ no SS3 row |
| 6 | Selectivity dev RE | partial of Parm_devs |
| 7-9 | q prior / SRR steepness prior | partial of Parm_priors |
| 10-12 | init_dev / rec_dev / R vs R_hat penalty | partial of Recruitment |
| 13 | F/B reference point | off when not in BRP mode |
| 14 | zero_N floor | no SS3 analogue |
| 15 | M1 prior | partial of Parm_priors |
| 16 | M random effects | partial of Parm_devs |
| 17-19 | ration / stomach | 0 in single-species |
| 20 | General parameter priors | partial of Parm_priors |

Recruitment bucket is expected to diverge because SS3 applies the
Methot-Taylor bias-adj ramp `b(y)` inside its NLL contribution, while
Rceattle uses a constant `0.5·σ²` offset. We accept this by design.

**Status: scaffolded but not validated against tolerance.**

```
ss3-to-rceattle bridge: hit 1e-3 biomass tolerance for GOA Pcod 2024

Twelve fixes to 2024_synthesis_to_pcod.R taking Bio max rel err from
~4 to 7.54e-04; R now at 2.61e-06. SSB still at 0.13 (Jensen's-
formulation gap, documented in HANDOFF.md).

Added R/ss3_to_rceattle.R: generalizable single-species SS3 -> Rceattle
converter with minage=0 (not yet tested end-to-end). Companion C++
patch to Rceattle/src/TMB/growth.hpp guards age_L1_safe against the
divide-by-zero when minage=0.

See HANDOFF.md for the full bug trail and exact next actions.
